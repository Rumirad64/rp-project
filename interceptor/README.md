## TCP Variables in Nginx

These variables in Nginx provide specific TCP information about the client connection, and they are typically used for logging or debugging purposes. These variables are available starting with Nginx version 1.11.3.

1. `$tcpinfo_rtt`: This variable provides the Round-Trip Time (RTT) for the TCP connection between the client and the server in microseconds. RTT is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from the source to the destination and back.

2. `$tcpinfo_rttvar`: This variable provides the RTT variance for the TCP connection between the client and the server in microseconds. Variance in RTT can be an indication of network congestion or other issues that might affect the quality of the connection.

3. `$tcpinfo_snd_cwnd`: This variable provides the size of the TCP send window (snd_cwnd) for the connection between the client and the server. The send window is a buffer that stores data that's ready to be sent across the network. The size of this window can adjust dynamically based on network conditions to optimize data transmission.

4. `$tcpinfo_rcv_space`: This variable provides the size of the TCP receive window (rcv_space) for the connection between the client and the server. The receive window is a buffer that stores incoming data until it can be processed.

In a typical use case, you might include these variables in the `log_format` directive to log this TCP information for each client request:

```
log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for" '
                'rtt: $tcpinfo_rtt, rttvar: $tcpinfo_rttvar, '
                'snd_cwnd: $tcpinfo_snd_cwnd, rcv_space: $tcpinfo_rcv_space';
```

Remember, these variables only work when Nginx is built with the `--with-stream_realip_module` configuration option, and when the connection is a TCP/IP connection. They will not work for Unix domain socket connections.

## Explanation of Nginx Variables

Sure, here's what each of these variables represent:

- `$remote_port`: This variable represents the source port from which the client sent the request to the Nginx server. 

- `$remote_addr`: This variable contains the IP address of the client (or the last proxy that sent the request).

- `$request_id`: This variable contains a unique request identifier generated by Nginx. It's useful for tracking individual requests in logs and for tracing a request's life cycle.


The `proxy_set_header` directive is used to re-define or append fields to the request header passed to the proxied server.

The TCP_INFO socket option isn't widely supported in Nginx, so `$tcpinfo_rtt`, `$tcpinfo_rttvar`, `$tcpinfo_snd_cwnd`, and `$tcpinfo_rcv_space` may not work in all configurations. If you want to use these variables, you may need to compile Nginx with additional modules or patches. Please check the current documentation or consult with a network engineer or systems administrator for the most accurate information.
